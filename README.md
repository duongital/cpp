# Games

Cover games that we all already know how to play!

During the time, I also learn and practice again several skills:

- DS and Algorithms
- OOP concepts
- Visualization and Math theories

To cover:

- [ ] snake game
- [ ] terris
- [ ] tic-tac-toe

Most of sub-folders using Raylib engine with C++ wrapper. Packages are managed with CMake:

```bash
cd sub_folder
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
./binary_file
```
